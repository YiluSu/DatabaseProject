<h1>Search Help</h1>
<p>Welcome to the help menu for the search page.</p>

<p>This page will allow you to search the Radiological Database. Only the records you have permission to view will be search, 
that is as a patient only your own records will be searchable, a doctor can opnly access records for his own patients, 
a radiologist will be able to search all records for tests he has performed.</p>

<p>Searches can be done by keyword, dates or both at once. Please note that both date fields must be filled for the search to go through.
Dates are inclusive, that is they include the date entered. For example to search for all records in 2007 enter Jan 1, 2007 in the 
Start Period box and Dec 31, 2007 in the End Period box, for records on a specific day enter that date in both boxes.</p>

<p>The default ranking criteria is a weighted frequency on the search keyword with the most frequent first. If no keyword is entered and 
no order for date selected the order will be by the order the records are stored in the table.</p>

<p>Once the search is done the records that fulfill the criteria will be displayed. If another search is desired then just enter it in the form above.</p>

<p>Clicking on the image thumbnail will open the image in a new window in the regular size. To view the image full size just click on the 
regular sized image in its new window.</p>
