<h1>Analysis Form</h1>
<p>
This form can be used to generate a data cube of image or record counts between the 
<b>start date</b> and <b>end date</b>.  
</p>
<p>
The <b>Time Period</b> allows you to drill down and rollup by specifying which time
periods are aggregated.  Selecting "All" aggregates all date values and removes that column.
</p>
<p>
The <b>User Class</b> specifies which type of user to use in the data cube.  If "All Users"
is select, then the resulting data does not display an per user information and instead all
rows represent values for any user in the remaining dimensions.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Count</b> lets you choose what is being counted.  You can choose either images or
radiological records.
</p>
<p>
All values must be specified before click the "submit" button.
