<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>
New family doctor relationships can be created by selecting a doctor and 
patient from the the two lists in the "Create" form.
</p>
<p>
Clicking the "Create" button will add a row to the family_doctor table 
which contains the two names.  The entry will appear on the list below 
in the "Delete" form.

<p>
If the relationship already exists, creating it again will have no effect.
</p>

Family doctor relationships can be deleted using the "Delete" form.  
After selecting which relationships to delete using the checkboxes on the 
left, click the "Delete" button.  The page will refresh and the selected
