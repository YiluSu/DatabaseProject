<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>
    Installation is a four part process:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Running the "admininformation" script</li>
    <li>Deploying to your catalina webapp folder</li>
    <li>Create the database tables and default admin user</li>
    <li>Logging in as the default admin</li>
</ol>

<h2>Running "admininformation"</h2>
<p>
    The "admininformation" script is a short Java program.  To run it execute the following commands (assuming you're
    in the root folder of the system):
</p>
<ol>
    <li><span class="code">cd proj</span></li>
    <li><span class="code">javac admininformation.java</span></li>
    <li><span class="code">java admininformation</span> (fill in the requested information)</li>
    <li><span class="code">cd ..</span></li>
</ol>

<h2>Deploying</h2>
<p>
    Before using the deploy script you'll have to set the <span class="code">CATALINA_BASE</span> environment variable
    to point to your catalina folder.  In most peoples cases this will be <span class="code">~/catalina</span> and the
    following command can be used:
</p>
<span class="code">export CATALINA_BASE=~/catalina</span>
<p>
    After setting the <span class="code">CATALINA_BASE</span> environment variable run the deploy script using:
    <span class="code">sh deploy.sh</span>.  Now you'll be able to access the system at <span class="code">http://HOST:PORT_NUM/proj/</span>
    where HOST is the hostname of the server the system installed on and PORT_NUM is the port number that tomcat is running on.
</p>

<h2>Populating the database</h2>
<p>
    Including in the system are two .sql files: setup.sql and init.sql.  Running setup.sql will create all of the tables.  
    Running init.sql will create all necessary indices as well as the default user.
    To run "setup.sql" and "init.sql", start "sqlplus" and run the following commands:
</p>
<span class="code">@setup.sql</span>
<span class="code">@init.sql</span>

<h2>Logging in for the first time</h2>
<p>
    After deploying the system you'll need to login as the default administrator.  Once logged in you can change the
    default admin password and create additional admin and user accounts.  The default admin credentials are "admin" (username) and
    "admin" (password).
